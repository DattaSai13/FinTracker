üêû Known Issues

SQL Injection Vulnerability: PHP files use unsanitized $_GET/$_POST inputs in SQL queries. Fix: Implement prepared statements (e.g., in upinc.php, income.php).
Textarea Bug: In edinc.php and edexp.php, textareas incorrectly use the value attribute. Fix: Replace with <textarea><?php echo htmlspecialchars($des ?? ''); ?></textarea>.
Error Message in exptable.php: Displays "No income records found" for empty expense tables. Fix: Update to "No expense records found".
Missing dele() Function: exptable.php lacks the delete confirmation function. Fix: Add <script>function dele() { return confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this expense?"); }</script>.


üîí Security Recommendations

Prepared Statements: Use MySQLi prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.$stmt = $con->prepare("INSERT INTO income (Source, Amount, Date, Description, Names) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)");
$stmt->bind_param("sdsss", $src, $amt, $dt, $des, $name);


Password Hashing: Hash passwords in signin.php using password_hash() and verify in login.php with password_verify().
Session Management: Replace $_GET["name"] with PHP sessions for secure user authentication.
CSRF Protection: Add CSRF tokens to forms to prevent cross-site request forgery.
Input Validation: Validate inputs (e.g., positive amounts, valid dates) on the server side.


üåü Future Enhancements

Visualizations: Add Chart.js bar/pie charts to new.php or analysis.php for income vs. expense visuals.
Pagination: Implement pagination in inctable.php and exptable.php for large datasets.
Export Functionality: Allow users to export records as CSV or PDF.
Mobile App: Develop a companion mobile app for on-the-go finance tracking.
Budget Alerts: Enhance new.php with customizable budget alerts.
